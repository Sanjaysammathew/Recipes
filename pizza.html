<h1>Description</h1>
<p>“Great recipe,” raves John Marks. “I love grilled pizzas. If done correctly, the crust comes out perfectly and it has that unique grilled taste.”

    “The dough rose well and was easy to work with,” according to Mr. D. “I added my own toppings: Canadian bacon, avocados, artichokes, black olives. It was wonderful!!”
    
    “The garlic folded into the dough really made it stand out, and I could have just eaten crust all night,” according to LazyFoodieGirl. “We ended up grilling a few empty ones and cutting them into breadsticks to dip into extra marinara sauce.”
