    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Biryani is a cherished and aromatic dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, renowned for its rich flavors and diverse regional variations. It typically consists of long-grain basmati rice layered with marinated meat—such as chicken, lamb, or beef—and a medley of fragrant spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. The cooking process often involves a method called “dum,” where the ingredients are sealed in a pot to allow steam to meld the flavors.

        Accompanied by sides like raita (yogurt sauce) or salad, biryani is not just a meal but a celebration of culture and tradition. Each region boasts its unique style, from the spicy Hyderabadi to the milder Lucknowi biryani. This beloved dish brings people together, often served at special occasions, feasts, and family gatherings, making it a true culinary masterpiece.</p>
